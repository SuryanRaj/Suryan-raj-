# 🌐 Suryan Raj's Language Learning Log

This is my personal language roadmap — a structured guide to the programming languages I want to learn, why I chose them, and how I plan to distribute my focus.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Strengthen **frontend development** skills
- Gain **core programming knowledge**
- Improve **problem-solving and logic**
- Learn tools used in **real-world development**

## 🧩 Learning Flow

1. **Start with Web Basics**  
   → HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
   Focus: Building static and dynamic websites

2. **Dive into Core Programming**  
   → Python, then C  
   Focus: Logic building, syntax mastery, and understanding low-level operations

3. **Advance to Frameworks**  
   → React + TypeScript  
   Focus: Real-world frontend development and app building

4. **Explore Back-End Basics (Optional Later)**  
   → SQL, Python Flask/Node.js  
   Focus: Complete understanding of web stacks
